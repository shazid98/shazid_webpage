        <p>
            I am a Computer Science graduate eager and passionate to learn and succeed in the field of DevOps and Cloud Computing. I am currently training at Sparta Global where I am learning the necessary skills to become a successful DevOps engineer and accomplish my aspirations.
        
            Although I have learned various computing concepts and programming languages such as Java, Python and SQL , Sparta Global allowed me to push myself and learn Cloud Computing, how to automate tasks and create pipelines using Jenkins, utilising microservices Architecture with AWS and much more. I have worked on communication skills, communicating effectively through daily stand-ups and regular presentations. My journey at Sparta Global has been really enjoyable, as I am someone who likes to learn new concepts and apply that knowledge.
        
            One of my biggest achievements is getting a first in a group project module led by me, where I have implemented an agile environment, resolving any hurdles encountered along the way. 
        
            In my spare time, I like to help out students who need assistance with subjects such as maths and physics, where I think I can make an impact. I do believe teaching is the best way to learn as it pushes you to learn things to the extent where you can explain them to others.
